True Healing is a mod that allows mobs to heal over time using a custom potion effect.

While the effect is active, affected entities regenerate through simple math applied to their current health. This applies equally to both undead and non-undead mobs; however, the effect does not apply to players.

For flexibility, the mod includes game rules for in-game configuration, allowing players to customize the experience to their liking.

This mod was created for me and my friends and is built using MCreator, so use at your own risk. I’m still new to modding, and while I’ve done my best to ensure stability, I want to provide fair warning in case of unforeseen issues.

Note: Due to a lapse in judgment, I initially released the mod for Forge 47.3.0 without proper notification. This has been corrected in Version 2, and I apologize for any unnecessary headaches this may have caused.
